Stats

Defensive Layers:
	Avoidance: avoiding getting hits	I believe that's where my game differs as you should be the one to avoid the attacks.
		evasion, block chance, chance to avoid damage
	Mitigation: when I get damage, I only get some of it
		Armor, elemental resistances, physical damage reduction
	Recovery: heal/ sustain
		life leech, health regeneration
	

Ward (LE) and Energy shield (PoE) are actually opposites.
	Ward is something you're constantly building while it decays.
	Energy shield is something that regenerates assuming you didn't get hit for 2 seconds.

	Ward rewards agressive non-stop playing
	Energy shield rewards careful, hit and run, guerilla playing
	
Idea: life leech to be able to get more health than your maximum, but it decays fast. So this type of gameplay can come from life based build, which is better suited for melee/fighter anyway.
Extra - life. Should it be percentage based (your base health) or real number?
	Real number: seperated from base health, it's easier to build, and makes it so a build can be very vulnerable before it gets the extra life. but I can give higher numbers that way.
	Percentage:  dependant on base health, this is more "rounded" approach but than scaling health will provide the extra health, makes me giving smaller numbers. and if you're building a large HP pool shouldn't it be enough already?
		Real number is probably more interesting. I can think of a unique item that gives you +X extra life maximum where X is your part of your health, but decreasing your max health.
	
	another interesting thing about extra life is that you can only get it from life leech or something similar. not from potions.

Mana shield is interesting.
	It puts more strain on the mana, somewhat balancing the very strong "magic" stats that both increase the offense and resource of spellcasting.
	can scale by both percentage of damage taken from mana and reduced damage taken.
	It also rewards using multiple skills and not spamming the biggest one all the time.
	However it makes the recovery for health and mana less streamlined. not necessariliy bad.
	it also increases the sense of danger as you're more careful with your somewhat finite resource.



Dual Masteries vs LE classes:
	GD pros:
		the "mix" is more interesting. it's less like you're playing a necromancer, here are some other nodes you can use. it's actually mixing two classes.
		many more unique combinations.
	GD Cons:
		harder to balance, all classes can go with all classes
	LE pros:
		the ability to choose a "mastery" is very rewarding, and something I like. Base joint class for few related archtypes. simialr to DND.
		There are essentialy 15 classses, 3 for each archtype. it's very cool.
	LE Cons:
		not the strong "mix" feeling that GD have. having any two skills in the game on the same character.
	
	specifics:
	GD liked:
		mastery going up increased all stats, distributed in a way that fits the class (+lots physics, +lots spirit, +little third one)
			if I make it so when you're investing skill points in normal nodes it raises your mastery level and ALSO mastery level raises your stats it might get confusing?
	GD liked:
		items open to everyone, but some have specific class bonuses (bonuses/modifiers to specific class skills, + to all class skills)
	LE liked:
		

What do I think about the LE progression?
Liked:
	Skills having depth and synergy between them:
		per-skill tree was interesting
		skills refering to other skills was interesting
	Mastery tree choice is a very rewarding moment
	Mastery choice passive bonus
	Access into part of other masteries
	Most points felt significant in the skill tree
	Most (but less) points felt significant in the passive skill tree
	Low attribute numbers
	Not needing to put a skill point to unlock a skill
	Investing skill points in nodes increases the mastery level (instead of the PLUS in Grim Dawn)

Didn't:
	maybe balance issue, but build felt almost "resolved" very early (also true for D2 for some builds)
	low number of skills on the bar
	idols. didn't enjoy that. (hard to diffrentiate character progression and itemization)

Not sure:
	Health / mana / ward raising with levels
	specializing in small number of skills / skill "specialization" in general
	Stats (vitality) only from gear and specific passive skill nodes
	Dodge is servicable.
		quick recovery cooldown and no cooldown between uses


Offensive:
	Increased X damage
	X damage penetration
	attack speed
	casting speed
	stun chance
	stun duration
	bleeding chance
	increased critical chance (base: 5%?)
	increased critical damage (default: 150%?)

Defensive:
	Armor
	Elemental Resistances
	Health
	Health regeneration (base?)
	Endurance (very cool! like in last epoch. below threshold reduced damage taken)
	Energy shield (like PoE)
	Energy shield regeneration?
	Life leech
	Maximum extra life (think of better name)
	Reduced Extra life decay?
