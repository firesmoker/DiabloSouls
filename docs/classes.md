Class progression:
I think I do tend towrad classes. Kinda like POE's version of them. I like the passive bonuses from choosing a mastery, and like having its own seperate tree. I also like last epoch's idea of giving the first half of each other mastery
I could also do a multiclass system like DND which could be innovative. Will be hard to balance though. But innovative.
I also really like Grim Dawn's approach of dual classing.
I do have fun with the tree for each skill. not sure I still like the limited number of "specializations" for them.
Like the simplified way that you put skill points into a tree and that tree levels up, instead of putting point into the PLUS for leveling up the tree in Grim Dawn/Titan Quest.
Mitigation chance?
Endurance from last epoch is pretty cool
Class restricted items? (if there are classes)
Copy path of exile and last epoch with the evasion/dodge? OR have everything be armor with extra stats that match the class/attribute?
