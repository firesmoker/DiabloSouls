Rarities:
	Artifact:		very powerful, lore meaningful items. Highest tier of them (Mythic?) could potentialy be best-in-slot. Quest related or very rare drop
	Set item?:		sets with bouses just like other ARPG. have higher tier to stay viable.
	Unique/Special:	item with unusual combination of affixes, including unique affixes. often build defining.
	MI type:		Can only be dropped from certain monsters, special implicits, can be good for target farming.
	Rare:			Prefix and Suffix each have a few affixes
	Magic:			Like Grim Dawn, prefix and and suffix have only one affix, but their numbers are higher than rare. Only good for extreme specialized builds and crafting?
	Normal:			Only good for crafting, if it exists, and while leveling. I like the idea of "rare base" like crossbow.


Weapon types
(STR)/(INT) etc. means the damage scales with it
Thrown ??
	Javelin (STR + DEX): # not so sure about this one
		STR(Med) + DEX(Med) requirement
		Highest base damage
		Slow attack speed

Ranged
	Longbows (DEX(100%) + STR(50%)):
		DEX(High?) + STR(Med?) requirement
		Highest projectile speed
		Highest base damage
		Slow attack speed
		I hate cooldowns. But maybe the best for very high consuming stamina builds. (due lack of rapid fire nature)
		
	Recurve bow (DEX(100%) + STR(25%)):
		DEX(High) requirement + STR(Low) requirement
		High projectile speed
		High base damage
		Medium attack speed
		Being that somewhere in the middle

	Short bow (DEX(100%)):
		DEX(High) requirement
		Medium projectile speed
		Medium base damage
		High attack speed
		Higher attack speed makes damage scaling with the flat added elemental quiver damage better than recurve/longbows, potential INT build

	Crossbow(None!)
		STR requirement (low)
		Highest projectile speed
		Highest base damage, but gets no bonuses, "noob weapon"
		Great for leveling and providing non DEX characters with a ranged attack
		Most expensive "base weapon"
		"Rare" base
		Best with INT using elemental bolts
		Lowest attack speed
		Attack bonus speed applies X2? makes it a weird DEX + INT???? probably better to ditch this idea, making the crossbow an INT item-focused slow hitting explosive build

	Wands (INT(100%)):
		INT requirement
		Medium base damage (Force(not resisted but doesn't have many scalers) / Elemental)
		Highest +Spell damage

	Arrow Quiver(Helper 2nd hand)
		Endless. Ammo is not fun
		Adds increased Medium physical / medium flat elemental damage (INT)

Potions:

do I like the potion use in LE? I played a very non-potion based character so it's hard to tell.
	potions like in POE is a real rabbit whole
