	The singer angel - main theme -duriel theme - composing the song about duriel, later you can find the rest of the song that tells the story of her downfall. she could be a character you save. super cooolllll

===============
I. Aurora Creates the Universe
In the beginning, there was Aurora, the primal deity. Aurora had no shape or form. Aurora sacrificed some of its essence to create the angels, also known as the divines. They, too, had no form.

The first, Kayne, was the mightiest of them all. He was anointed as God by Aurora. The second, Abel, was only lesser to Kayne. Aurora acknowledged Kayne's superiority but saw potential in Abel. Aurora gave the order to Kayne and Abel that on the day Abel would be ready, Kayne would transfer some of his power to Abel, so they would rule together as the joint Gods. This divine order later became known as the Godkin Prophecy.

Each successive angel that was born was lesser in power than its predecessor.

Aurora created a holy device called the Stone of Creation, allowing it to transform holy essence into matter. Using the stone, it sacrificed all of its remaining essence to create the material universe and most living creatures. This act became known as the Dawn of the Earth.

II. The Conflict Between Kayne and Abel
Many eons later, Kayne never accepted that Abel was ready to rule with him. Abel and many of his followers began to question Kayne's intentions and accused him of betraying Aurora's orders. Kayne didn't budge, as he was more powerful than all of the other divines combined.

Abel planned a scheme to dethrone Kayne and become God. He and many of his followers would use the Stone of Creation to catch Kayne by surprise and overpower him.

The main problem was the fourth angel, Duriel. She was extremely loyal to God Kayne and was revered by many of the divines.

III. Duriel, the Legendary Angel Warrior
A few thousand years back, one of Abel's followers, the fifth angel named Astaroth, betrayed the heavens and mounted a surprise attack on Duriel. He had murdered many angels in secret, preparing for this attack. When an angel kills another, they absorb the victim's power. Astaroth became stronger than Duriel and was convinced of his victory, already planning how he would challenge Abel next.
However, Duriel was the most skilled warrior among the divines, and she managed to defeat him in an epic battle despite the overwhelming odds. Thus, she became much more powerful, approaching Abel's own power. This is one of the reasons Abel was eager to dethrone Kayne and become God — Duriel becoming stronger than himself, while she served Kayne's right hand, would mean eternal servitude. Kayne would most likely make Duriel the joint God, if at all.

IV. The Fall of Kayne
The third angel, Raguel, was known for his kindness but also for his naivety. Duriel fell in love with him, admiring his peaceful ways and how he was the only angel loved by all. Abel recognized this fact as the only weakness Duriel might have. He encouraged Raguel to accept Duriel's love (which Raguel was not entirely aware of) and to spend time alone with her. Raguel, who trusted Abel more than any other, was extremely happy to learn of this fact and followed Abel's advice.

The time was ripe for Abel's plan. On the day Raguel and Duriel spent time together, Abel took the Stone of Creation. He and his followers managed to surprise Kayne. They channeled all of their power into the Stone of Creation to tear Kayne apart into matter. Those parts created the humans and other unique creatures. Kayne was slightly stronger than them when they attacked, and his resistance shattered the stone in the middle of the process. He became a shell of his former self, much weaker than he was, and finally weaker than Abel.

Abel and the other followers used their power to forcefully bind him into a contract (more of a curse) to never absorb the souls of the dead creations made out of him — the humans and other fantastical creatures. This meant he would never be able to regain his power. He would be the one to return those souls into the reincarnation cycle so they would be born again.

This was the Dread Contract, anointing Kayne to serve as Death for all eternity, in the void of souls known as the Underworld.

V. The New Order
Duriel, arriving too late to the scene, was horrified to learn what had transpired. She confronted Abel, demanding he reverse this betrayal. Abel, grinning, reminded her that her loyalty lies with God, which he now was. Duriel's spirit shattered, and she spent more than a hundred years in solitude.

In the coming days, the heavens split, as many would not acknowledge Abel's legitimacy. Many left, led by none other than Raguel, the angel of kindness himself. Despite his good nature, he was very powerful as the third angel to be created.

Another powerful angel, Gabriel, one of Abel's most trusted followers, decided to join Raguel. Even though he played a central part in Abel's plan, he showed remorse and asked for forgiveness. He said that witnessing Abel's victory had revealed his true colors. Raguel accepted Gabriel's forgiveness and welcomed him into his service.

It was later found out that Gabriel took the pieces of the shattered Stone of Creation in secret, to prevent Abel from gaining more power. It was surprisingly easy, as Abel was so drunk with the taste of victory and his newfound superiority, he completely lowered his guard.

Raguel and his followers created the Second Divine Order, also known as the Congregation.

Duriel finally returned from her solitude. Raguel tried to convince her to join the Congregation and create the divine order of the future. Surprisingly, Duriel rejected him. She said that, unfortunately, Abel was right, as he is now the only God and his word is law. He was always meant to become the second God to rule with Kayne. Duriel kissed Raguel goodbye and swore to never love again. She would never be weak again.

Duriel came to Abel, surrendering herself to his service. She became the captain of the guard.

VI. The Death of God
Two hundred years later, the horizon darkened. Thousands of twisted angels attacked the heavens, approaching Abel's hall. The attack was led by none other than Gabriel, who was glittering with the shards of the Stone inserted into his flesh. Many of the other attacking angels had a tiny shard in them as well.

A battle took place in Abel's hall between Duriel, Abel, and Gabriel. In the end, Gabriel fell, Duriel barely survived, but Abel was decapitated. The heavens managed to repel Gabriel's forces, suffering terrible losses. But there was no more God, and Death's contract was finally over. Strange, dark creatures quickly started to emerge and attack the heavens, and the souls of the dead were no longer joining the reincarnation cycle.

Duriel, now the highest-ranking angel, consulted with her followers. They realized the main culprit behind the attack was Death himself, who had somehow managed to influence Gabriel.

After witnessing the power of the stone, the heavens decided that Duriel should be the one to hold its power. Together with Duriel, they augmented her body with all the remains of the stone.

Duriel and an army of elite warriors mounted a final attack on the Underworld to finish the ancient feud.

However, it seemed that Death wasn't truly defeated, as the attacks on the living continued, and Duriel and her army were never heard from again.





Basic Premise:
God is dead, and Death has broken loose, no longer bound by his contract.
The legendary angel of war, Duriel, led an army of angels to avenge God's demise and defeat Death, but they have all disappeared.
In the next few hundred years, dark creatures began to roam the earth but were mostly contained by the divine order of clerics and other brave warriors.

But now, an attack on a scale never seen before has ravaged much of of humanity.
You are one of the few survivors of the attack, in the small village named Firstlight.
You begin by helping other survivors by rescuing them from demons around the ruined village as you run away to the shelter of the divine barrier around Duriel's Temple.
=========================================================================================

	
	
The main villain: Death
His power was always kept in check by the [divines]
He has managed to break free of their checks and go rogue
He is the source of all the shit and the dark powers

He will comment on the hero's path (Dark slayer, Hero of the people, Divine Champion)

Tons of buildup for him throught the story
Menu music when getting into his [temple] - it's the final showdown.





Death gets stronger as he started to absorb the souls of the dead instead of slowly releasing them into the incarnation cycle as his contract endorced him.

He broke free of the contract by aligning himself with an (angel) that betrayed (the heavens) and killed (god).

He sought more power and control and death promised him that.

He could be the penultimate boss battle

The angel [duriel] was mistaken all the time for the main hero, the symbol of the resistance against death. As he was seen charging into death's depths after god's demise.
Of course he was just pretending to get an excuse to go and join death and distract everyone from the truth

there could be a large statue of him in the town

it could be that you're even told when you start getting blessed that there must be some connection to [duriel] or something like that

the opening cinematic, narrator, etc. could even just lie to you telling the heroic actions of [duriel]

Duriel sword could be a cool unique item that is corrupted and can be cleansed to become the blessed version

(uniques must not be leveled. I fucking hate it)

Duriel's avenger could be a thing that people call you

I really want flavor text for uniques

build up for uniques (as much as possible)

at least for some of them

one of the things I don't like about unique weapons is that you want higher damage and you tend to switch them more frequently. ifi they have something build-enabling, it can suck...
if something like Duriel Sword has a build-enabling thing, it should have a very significant bump in damage

the death voice should include voices of many dead souls, men, women, children, screams

maybe it could trigger it with side-chaining

i could also use my audio assets from lunar station

soul veil? the way death gets stronger by using souls is building the soul veil? soul armor? need to think about it

should I have sockets in my game? death's unique being a socket item is awesome

could be applied to most builds

it could be the stone that is the base of the soul veil

it could be a leveled unique that gets stronger by killing enemies. it could encourage a second playthrough through the nightmare mode

it could also have a special slot in the inventory, or be a charm

I think I want it to feel less of a "feature" that is too built in, as it will just be a feature unlock and not a super cool item that you hold and feel

I don't like the very open nature of the inventory and putting charms in there. it could be more like a belt stalker-style

maybe just steal this mechanism

like radioactivity, something else

feature creeeeeep

not really. I haven't planned itemization so far.

this could all be part of PART 2 of the game. the diablo game, not the PART 1 fighting / arena / waves game

final fight against death should be very, very hard

there should be tons of warnings along the way about stuff he does, and other tips to make the player prepare

death and his soul veil should take a very large part of the screen

fallout style slideshow. no real animated cinematics, sounds like nightmare to develop

take hints from PoE 2 about many gameplay mechanics

Perry progression:
* number of enemies you can perry at the same time
* strength of attacks you can perry
* Window of opportunity length
* special effects?
* projectiles?
* how much stamina

Counter:
* Same as perry?
* damage / special effects?

Should dodge just be the "roll" or classic dodge? if it takes stamina it removes the cooldown mechanic which isn't nice

shielded enemies? counter as the best way to do it?
skills that helps you break shields?
how can I make it so a build doesn't just overpower shields with sheer numbers?

TOTAL SHIELD with type:
when shield is on, enemy is immune to type. So it's harder for specific-type builds (like fire), but it's not impossible, it would make them put effort into breaking/bypassing the shield

it's fun that every build has pros/cons

with some builds harder to some

boss resistance, but not immunity to type

maybe some elite enemies do have immunity

make sure immunities resistances are balanced. about the same amount of enemies for each

mechanicly - if you press the perry button, it takes all enemies in the direction of your mouse and chooses the best one - a counter. if few counters - one under mouse or random one.

should counter make you invlunerable?
maybe only to normal attacks and not non-perriable?



God is actually the original god's brother.
Death is the original god.
God, together with some angels, used the (stone of creation) to betray his brother and morph him into Death we know today.
It bound him to the process of herding souls into the underworld and back into the reincarnation cycle.

(who had Death's role prior to the transformation?)

Death, betrayed, became resentful. The "demotion" he has recieved and the power he lost were demeaning for him.

Duriel was the original god champion. He is very authoritarian, and when the new god ascended, he had no choice but to serve him.
That's when he decided on his plan. He managed to contact Death through servants, and Death's told him that the righteous thing to do is to execute the "false god".

Duriel killed God (by himself? other plan? made him die by something else? someone else killed him by his order?)

He later charged against Death in order to meet with him, and deliver the stone of creation to him.
He was his master, and he wished to serve him.
Over centuries he amassed an army, that its entire purpose was to serve his old God.

He served Death for a long time, and because of his blind obidience, he didn't see him for what he has become.
He and the other angels were all twisted as well by Death's dark forces.

In the end, it's a tragedy as he is sure he's doing the right thing, right until the hero defeats him.
Maybe if the hero is on the divine champion path, he will reconcile.

The endgame could be to make the Soulstone, which is the essence of the soul veil, back into its former version as the stone of creation, breaking it, recreating the incarnation cycle and releasing its trapped souls into it.

Maybe ascending to godhood? becoming the new God?


The brothers God and Death had a father OR mother. Father Aurora, the Dawn, the Beginning or Scitilla, the spark (of life)

Let's call the brothers Kayne and Abel (Abel is the dead God and Kayne is Death)

There were many other children, each one much less powerful than the one before him. The order of birth also created their ranks, some of which will later change due merit.

The last child of god could be a cool concept for one of the characters!

After giving birth to the last child, Aurora created the Stone of Creation, and used their own essence as sacrifice to create the material world.

(they means the father or mother)
They chose Kayne, as the eldest son, to lead the world as God. Abel didn't show the confidence, and was less powerful then Kayne, so they told Kayne and promised Abel that one day, when he is ready, Kayne will let Abel ascned in rank and power (taken directly from himself) and for them to lead jointly, as the "Godkin"

After eons, Abel seemed ready. Kayne, however, kept insisting that Abel still isn't.
Abel and his followers started to say Kayne is betraying Aurora's trust by not fulfilling the Godkin legacy.

Abel finally used his and his followers powers, with the Stone of Creation to disperese and transform large part of Kayne's essence into lesser beings, creating the living creatures, including humans.

This weakened Kayne tremendously, and they binded him to reincarnate the souls back into living creatures, never letting him re-assemble himself.

This is why Kayne, now Death, feels the "right" to the souls of all living creatures, as they were created from him without his consent.


He slowly transormed the stone of creation into the Soulstone, brutally clumping souls together to be merged into his old power.

COOL IDEA THE SOULSTONE IMAGE WILL SHOW SOULS AS THEY ARE GETTING ABSORBED WHEN YOU KILL ENEMIES


but what about all the "leftover" angels?
should I care about the 3rd, 4th, etc. children?

What rank was Duriel? When was she born?
Duriel is the 3rd, and she's a woman



Because of their limited powers, they only provide powers slowly, based on merit. They are very conservative about giving one individual lots of power.

Their main doing is overall keeping the human race and other living beings.

Half of Aurora's power was given to the children, 32 overall.
Kayne was 1/3 as powerful as Aurora, and each consecutive child was 1/3 as powerful as the one before.

The third child is Raguel, angel of kindness and love. He was naive. He was close friend of Abel.
Duriel is a girl! She loved Raguel.
Abel used Duriel's love for Raguel to distract her, distancing her from the moment he and his followers confronted Kayne and transformed him.

Raguel stayed with Abel, but was more distanced. He felt he can't tell right from wrong anymore. Abel, as the new God, ordered him and all angels to never reveal the truth to the human race.
He said it's better for them to percieve the divine order this way. The knowledge that they're part of Death could create chaos, and will lead to their ultimate self destruction.



Raguel then disappeared. Later found out he gave birth to 30 children. They are the second divine order.
They are the one that gives the hero the blessing.


When Abel and his followers ambushed Kayne and used their and the creation stone power to transform him, he used all of his powers to resist.

The stone of creation, itself weaker than Kayne's pure power, shattered in the process. Its center, its core, was the most dense, and it stayed intact, but the rest shattered into shards.

How did they kill God Abel?
Duriel stuck the shards, thousands of them, into herself, and took the core.
It amplified her strength, and in one swift move, when Abel's guard was completely down, she decapitated him.

Death later had to surgically remove all shards from her. It left her with hideous scars all over her body.

After turning the stone into the Soulstone:
Death, obssessed with loyalty and control, used some of the biggest shards into his most powerful followers, augmenting their powers with the powers of the stone and himself. It included Duriel.


Death's creatures are part of himself just like the normal living beings, but as he made them himself, and not them being taken out of him by force, he has complete control and loyalty by them.

Maybe part of the transformation was making him vulnerable to light, to keep him in the Underworld. Even though he broke his contract, this condition is something that takes lots of time and power to heal?


Are there other worlds? what about the sun? did aurora create the entire universe, or just the known world? did he create the sun and the moon?

Maybe Aurora created the entire universe with 90 percent of their essence.

They only sacrificed one tenth to create the children?

gives me more options in the future and sets up the power levels better.
